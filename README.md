*The end is nigh!*
But we have prepared. With this application we can translate from English to Zombiese and from Zombiese to English.  Zombies, being of rotten and rotted minds, cannot distinguish between "ei" and "u."  As such, "weird" translated into Zombiese and then back into English will appear as "wurd."  Such is un-life.

## The Rules

The rules are as follows:

lower-case "r" at the end of words replaced with "rh".
an "a" or "A" by itself will be replaced with "hra".
the starts of sentences are capitalized (the "start of a sentence" is any occurrence of ".!?", followed by a space, followed by a letter.)
"e" or "E" is replaced by "rr"
"i" or "I" is replaced by "rrRr"
"o" or "O" is replaced by "rrrRr"
"u" or "U" is replaced by "rrrrRr"
"r" or "R" is replaced by "RR"
zombies can't count; any digit or digits are replaced by "?"
"food," regardless of case, is replaced by "BRAINS"

## How to use

In the application itself, typing something in the English text box will result in an automatic translation into Zombiese.  To translate back to Englih, just click on the Zombiese text box.

Karma should be run from the "js" directory ("zombie_translator/js/").
